    Compute a binary ROI mask of the same shape as the input signals, using

    Parameters
    ----------
    signals : np.ndarray
        Array of shape (n_samples, sequence_length). Each row represents a 1D signal.
    positions : np.ndarray
        Array of shape (n_samples, n_peaks). Each entry is a floating-point
