    """
    Compute a binary ROI mask of the same shape as the input signals, using
    the given peak positions and a width specified in pixels.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signals : np.ndarray
        Array of shape (n_samples, sequence_length). Each row represents a 1D signal.
    positions : np.ndarray
        Array of shape (n_samples, n_peaks). Each entry is a floating-point
        position of a peak in [0,1] range, or 0 if no peak exists.
    width_in_pixels : int
        The width around each peak (in pixels) to mark as ROI. The function will
        mark Â±(width_in_pixels // 2) around each peak center.

    Returns
    -------
